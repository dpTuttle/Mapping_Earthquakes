# Mapping_Earthquakes


The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. To complete this project, we used a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website to retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then added the data to a map. 

##### Tools:
The approach was to use the JavaScript and D3.js libraries to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. We used the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and created interactivity for the earthquake data.
